# Python/DevOps/SRE/cloud  Proffesor :


#### All these years I wanted to become a python proffesional and use those skills in DevOps/SRE/CLOUD but all my time I am roaming here and there for the best book or best course available in the market but I am lost in that thought . 


#### Hence I decided to learn multiple books and course and filter that knowledge and keep a notes or outline of that learning activity so that me or anyone starting with python/go lang can refer this repository and travel with the repository deploying their own project or web application or automation to aws cloud atleast trying with the available coding styles, design patterns and efficent python coding models if possible i will also try to learn and include best software architechtures in the same repository. 

#### This should a one stop repeaet mode learning location  or like they say zero to hero in python . I am not expecting zero to hero . I will be happy if someone uses this repository and joins a junior position can atleast understand what the senior/proffesional python developer is expecting or explaining on the code developed and how he is gonna deploy and deliver it.






## ANNOUNCEMENT 
####  Let us call the syllabus as to-do list. If it is a syllabus, my brain procrastinates. 
#### let us train our brain to do actions rather than behaving like a born genius just reading a line and feeling that I understood everything.
#### great things take time, it's ok if my co-employee hits a higher package than me, but it is not ok for me to skip a concept or program without practicing. 
###  I will continously learn and give some energy to this branch untill I get a good package in any of the dream role I have mentioned in the heading , perfection and best are stupid words dont belive them it is the continous effort and the travel and learnings thats what companies pay for you not for the drama .
